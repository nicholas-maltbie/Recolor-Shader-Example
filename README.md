# Recolor Shader Example

This project demonstrates an example of how to use the Recolor shader developed in URP to recolor a grey scale image
using two different colors dynamically. 

This project is developed using Unity  [LTS Release 2020.3.14f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.14).

# Project Layout

Here is a description of the various directories in the project
* `Assets/Scenes` contains various scenes for the example project. Each scene is numbered and progress in order
  1, 2, ... This readme file will explain the assets in each scene.
